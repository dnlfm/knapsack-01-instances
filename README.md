# 0-1 Knapsack Problem Instances

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of instances for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. These instances were originally sourced from [Pisinger's homepage](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~pisinger/codes.html). The direct download links from the original source are no longer functional, so they have been preserved here for continued access.

## Utilization in Research
The instances available in this repository were utilized in a comparative study of algorithms based on the meta-heuristics Firefly Algorithm and Tabu Search, as documented in the following paper: [Comparação de Algoritmos baseados nas Meta-Heurísticas Firefly Algorithm e Tabu Search](https://proceedings.science/sbpo/sbpo-2020/trabalhos/comparacao-de-algoritmos-baseados-nas-meta-heuristicas-firefly-algorithm-e-tabu) (in Portuguese). This study was presented at SBPO 2020.

## Accessing the Instances
You can find the instances in the repository's files. They are available for download and use in research, educational projects, and solution development related to the 0-1 Knapsack Problem.
