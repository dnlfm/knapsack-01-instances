# 0-1 Knapsack Problem Instances

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of instances for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. It includes two sets of instances sourced from different authors, preserved here for academic and educational use.

## Instances

### Pisinger Instances (`pisinger_instances_01_KP`)
The Pisinger instances were originally sourced from [Pisinger's homepage](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~pisinger/codes.html). The direct download links from the original source are currently not functional. These instances have been preserved in this repository under the folder `pisinger_instances_01_KP`.

### Xiang Instances (`xiang_instances_01_KP`)
The Xiang instances are included based on the work by Xiang et al. in their paper titled "A Novel Discrete Global-Best Harmony Search Algorithm for Solving 0-1 Knapsack Problems," published in Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society. The citation is as follows:
Xiang, W., An, M., Li, Y., He, R., and Zhang, J. (2014). A Novel Discrete Global-Best Harmony Search Algorithm for Solving 0-1 Knapsack Problems. Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, 2014:1-12. These instances are available in the folder `xiang_instances_01_KP`.

## Utilization in Research
Both sets of instances available in this repository were utilized in a comparative study of algorithms based on the meta-heuristics Firefly Algorithm and Tabu Search, as documented in the following paper: [Comparação de Algoritmos baseados nas Meta-Heurísticas Firefly Algorithm e Tabu Search](https://proceedings.science/sbpo/sbpo-2020/trabalhos/comparacao-de-algoritmos-baseados-nas-meta-heuristicas-firefly-algorithm-e-tabu) (in Portuguese). This study was presented at SBPO 2020.

## Accessing the Instances
You can find the instances in the respective folders within the repository. They are available for download and use in research, educational projects, and solution development related to the 0-1 Knapsack Problem.
